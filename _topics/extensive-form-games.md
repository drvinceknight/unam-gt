## Typical Coding Exercises

1. Create a variable `normal_form_game` which has value the Normal Form Game
   that corresponds to the extensive form game shown [here](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/main11.png).
2. Output the Normal Form Game that corresponds to the extensive form game shown
   [here](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/main10.png).
