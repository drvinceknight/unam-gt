## Typical Coding Exercises

1. Create a variable `repeated_game` which has value the Normal Form Game obtained by repeating the following stage game twice:
   $$A = \begin{pmatrix}1 & - 1\\ -1 & 1\end{pmatrix} \qquad B = \begin{pmatrix}-1 & 1\\ 1 & -1\end{pmatrix}$$
2. Output the Normal Form Game obtained by repeating the following zero sum game twice:
   $$A = \begin{pmatrix}-3 & - 1 & 4\\ 2 & -1 &  1\end{pmatrix}$$
