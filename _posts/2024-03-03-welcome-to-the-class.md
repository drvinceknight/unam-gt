Welcome to you if you have chosen S3611MT (Game Theory).

This is a brief message before our first class.

All of the course materials (including short videos) are available at
[vknight.org/unam-gt/](https://vknight.org/unam-gt/).

I am a visiting lecturer here and so look forward to learning from you as much
as you will learn from me.

This course is in some places similar to a course I teach at my home University
(Cardiff University) but there are a couple of things that are different.

One important consideration is that I will be located in Windhoek until the 30th
of March. We will either continue to learn Game Theory together using a virtual
platform (such as Zoom) or we will aim to compress more class in to the
timetable while I am here. I'll be keen to hear your thoughts on this.

I am incredibly excited about the opportunity to teach at the University of
Namibia and I look forward to getting to know you.
