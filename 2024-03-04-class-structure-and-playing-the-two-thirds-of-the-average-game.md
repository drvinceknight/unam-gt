It was nice to meet you all today/

In class we spoke about the general structure of the class and you can find that
information here: [https://vknight.org/gt/topics/about-the-course.html](https://vknight.org/gt/topics/about-the-course.html).

We played the two thirds of the average game.

The guesses for the first time we played the game were:

```
20, 37, 53, 25, 64, 80, 52
```

The average was: `47.29` which has 2/3rds: `31.52`. The winning guess was `37`.

After this we discussed how if **everyone** guessed 0 this would be an
equilibrium.

Following this rationalisation we played again.
The guesses for the second time we played the game were:

```
27, 19, 30, 30, 24, 25, 54
```

The average was: `29.86` which has 2/3rds: `19.9`. The winning guess was `19`.

We discussed how this did not in fact correspond to the equilibrium. At first
that might feel like something is wrong with the mathematics but in fact what
we're seeing is how the behaviour is slowly shifting towards the equilibrium.

After this I pointed you all at the class notes where you can see the definition
of a Normal Form Game.
